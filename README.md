# Blazor And SignalR

This repository demonstrates the integration of Blazor and SignalR to build real-time web applications. Blazor allows you to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, while SignalR facilitates real-time communication between the server and client.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Demonstrates real-time data updates using SignalR.
- **Blazor Integration**: Shows how to use Blazor components and handle events.
- **Full-stack C#**: Build both the client-side and server-side logic using C#.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or later
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later with ASP.NET and web development workload
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you are using any frontend build tools)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevsharp/BlazorAndSignalR.git
   cd BlazorAndSignalR
